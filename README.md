- 👋 Hi, I’m @pinterarpad1977
- 👀 I’m interested in Python and I am interested in everything what you can do with code.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python but I am still at a novice level. I hope to find a junior coder job and build myself up from there.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything to grow my skills and confidence.
- 📫 How to reach me: I am absolutely new here, but I suppose you can reach me here or on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/arpad-pinter-72276224/
