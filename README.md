Hi, I’m @pinterarpad1977 (Arpad he/him) based in Europe, Hungary.

I’m interested in Python and I now started to learn JavaScript too
My experience is mostly data related (Pandas, NLP, NumPy, some SQL)
Unfortunately I cannot learn on the job, I am a data analyst, but working solely on Power BI.
 
I’m currently intermadiate in Python but I am still at a novice level in JavaScript.

I hope to find a junior coder job and build my experience on the job.
