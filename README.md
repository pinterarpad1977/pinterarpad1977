- 👋 Hi, I’m @pinterarpad1977
- 👀 I’m interested in Python and I now started to learn JavaScript too
- My experience is mostly data related (Pandas, NLP, NumPy, some SQL)
- 🌱 I’m currently intermadiate in Python but I am still at a novice level in JavaScript. I hope to find a junior coder job and build my experience on the job.
